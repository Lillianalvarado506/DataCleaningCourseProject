# DataCleaningCourseProject
Contains the files for the Project to fulfill requirements for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course
# This repository contains 3 items:
1. run_analysis.R contains the R script that uploads and cleans up the data for wearable devices
2. Codebook.md:  A markdown file that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
3. READ.me: A file that explains how the script works, contents of the repository, and how the contents are connected.

#Details of run_analysis.R:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
